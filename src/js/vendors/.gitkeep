The purpose of the .gitkeep file is to solve problem of Git not pushing empty folders to remote DVCS repos like GitHub or GitLab.
To get Git to recognize an empty directory, the unwritten rule is to put a file named .gitkeep in it.
Git will see the .gitkeep file in the otherwise empty folder and make that folder part of the next commit or push.
